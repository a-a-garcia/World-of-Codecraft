#1 Instead of clicking the text of the weapon, create a "pick up weapon" button next to each weapon. (Anthony - completed on 04.03.2023! Next, I want to eventually remove the "weapon in use" at the bottom and just create a function to change the button to show "equipped" once the user equips a weapon &does not allow them to click it again -since they already equipped it-.)

#2 Create some sort of graphic that displays next to the cursor when a weapon is successfully picked up.

#3 Create a "battle" interface at the button that displays information about the battle IE - "player one hits player two with X weapon for Y Damage"

#4 Display some sort of animation or gif when attack button is pressed.

#5 Display some sort of animation or gif when player one or player two dies.

#6 Create an attack button for player two.

#7 Create weapon durability function - weapons should have durability, reduces each time you attack with said weapon. Once durability reaches zero, do not allow user to pick that weapon anymore. (grey it out)

#8 Create armor functions allow user to be able to equip armor which reduces the amount of damage they take

#9 Create spells - fireball, heal (restores health) - would need to create mana?

#10 Create health and mana bars that correlate to the % of health that each player has. It should move dynamically when health is decreased or increased.

#11 Create a weapons available array of all possible weapons (not just the ones that a player has in their weapons array) + display it on the page.

#12 Make it evident which weapon is currently equipped once a weapon is selected.
(Carlos Will work on this)

#13 Create a turn based system in that once an decision is made by player one or player two, that player cannot act again until the other player has made their turn.
(Luke Jech working on back-end function)

#14 PLayers can input their own names
(Carlos can Work on this)

#15 Single player version with player 2 being "AI" computer opponent.

#16 A button that displays the text "start over" when the game ends (when the player has 0 health?) and restarts the game.
